# Spec Delta: `creonow-v1-workbench` (docs-only)

This Rulebook task delivers a new OpenSpec package at:

- `openspec/specs/creonow-v1-workbench/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/creonow-v1-workbench/design/`
- `openspec/specs/creonow-v1-workbench/task_cards/`

No business code is included in this task. The new spec is Windows-first and intended to be directly executable by implementation agents (PR-sized task cards + Playwright Electron E2E as gate).
